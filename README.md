# Globify

The same app that i've done in Vanilla js, is in Angular. You can login yourself with your own Spotify account.

## I invite you to localhost another version of the app :) 

Once you download this .zip, remember to install all the dependences. So, in the terminal:

```python
npm install
```

Now, in order to make this function, you will need to run the server. Enter to the file through the terminal in git using the following command:

```python
npm start
```

[Run the Server Here](http://localhost:3000)

[Run the App Here](http://localhost:4200)
